# BookSwap_app_flutter
I will build a BookSwap app, a small marketplace where students can list textbooks they wish to exchange and initiate swap offers with other users. This project requires both frontend (UI/UX with Flutter) and backend (Firebase for authentication, data storage, and real-time updates).
